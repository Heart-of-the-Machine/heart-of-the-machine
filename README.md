# Heart of the Machine
Heart of the Machine is a ModFest 1.16 entry.

Heart of the Machine adds a whole new dimension of abandoned machinery to explore. Maybe you can uncover the secrets of
this dimension and make use of them somehow.

## This Mod is Currently Unstable
Notice: This mod is still under development and is likely to have key aspects changing. This mod is not recommended for
production use.

## Getting to the Nectere Dimension
The Nectere (or Nexus) dimension can be accessed through portals that generate at surface level in the overworld. You
can locate them using the `/locate nectere_portal` command. Beware, the Nectere dimension has some pretty wacky terrain
and you may want to bring some building blocks just in case you end up spawning in on a cliff or a floating island.
