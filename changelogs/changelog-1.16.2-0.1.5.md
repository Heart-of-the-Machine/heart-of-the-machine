# Version 0.1.5
For Minecraft 1.16.2.

* Updated the mod to Minecraft 1.16.2.
* Slightly changed the Nectere Portal biome blacklist so that it checks the biome the actual portal block is placed in
  instead of the biome that generates the feature.
* Added a command, `/retrogen_nectere_portal`, to retro-gen the nearest non-Nectere-side portal if it is missing. The
  nearest portal is determined using the same logic as the non-Nectere-side `/locate` command.
